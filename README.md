- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Johnthesuper117
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, playing and coding them
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning How to make video games
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'M/HIM
- âš¡ Fun fact: It started in middle school when I learned that my friend was coding games on Roblox, and I thought "Hey, if he can, why not I?" So, them I started learning a lot in Scratch.mit.edu, and here I am now!
